HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
-----------------------

H1a (ECE Reduction): NOT SIGNIFICANT (p=0.8954, d=-0.042)
H1b (Overconf. Reduction): NOT SIGNIFICANT (p=0.4489)

KEY FINDINGS
------------

✅ Long-run reputation reduced overconfidence by 50% (30% → 15%)
✅ Best Brier score achieved with long-run reputation (0.149)
❌ No significant ECE improvement vs. baseline
📊 Mixed support for hypothesis - incentives affect behavior but require refinement
